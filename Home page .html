    <h2><b>A message from Our Principal</b></h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>Dear all the members of GBS family and well-wishers,
    I am honored and privileged, to be appointed as the 14th Principal of Gandaki Boarding School (GBS), Nepal Government designated National School. I am really excited to be the first ever ex-student of GBS, being selected in the leadership position of this great institution by the management committee and The Ministry of Education. As we begin a new era at GBS, I would like to share my new vision for the school.</p>
